### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's George Zhang. I'm finishing up my last year as a computer science student at UCLA. I currently work as a software engineering intern at [Figma](https://www.figma.com). In the past, I've worked at [Dynasty](https://www.dynasty.com) and [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com). I try my best to always learn more and build cool things ðŸŒ±.  I can be reached at georgezhang@ucla.edu if that's something that interests you.
